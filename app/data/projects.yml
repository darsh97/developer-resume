    summary: A startup idea based on recommendations for users based off of mutual followers
      and interests. I spent over a year working on the concept in my off-time. In the end, I created
      the product in too much of a vacuum. It was a hard lesson learned in the importance of keeping a product
      simple and getting it in front of actual users as soon as possible. It was also probably my masterpiece
      in terms of clean and maintanable C# code - another reason why the project failed as the time should have
      been spent elsewhere.
